Mct Clone Maggi Website Using html and css


#explanation:
html:-
The HTML document starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, specifying the document type.
The <html> element is the root element of the HTML document.
The <head> section contains meta information about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and the page title.
Inside the <head>, there are <meta> tags specifying the character encoding and viewport settings.
The page title is set using the <title> element.
External CSS files are linked using the <link> element, which includes links to Font Awesome and Bootstrap CSS libraries, as well as a local style.css file.
The <body> element represents the main content of the webpage.
The website is divided into different sections using <div> elements and <section> elements.
The navbar section is represented by a <div> with the class "navbar". It contains a background image, a logo, and a list of navigation items.
The main content section is represented by a <main> element containing a <div> with the id "home". It includes a heading, a search input field, and a set of buttons.
The recipes section is represented by a <section> element with the id "pic". It displays recipe cards with images, titles, ratings, and other details.
The other sections, such as "Sunday Maggi Masti," "Favourite Maggi," and "Recipes Side bar," follow a similar structure with images, headings, descriptions, and buttons.
The footer section is represented by a <footer> element containing social media icons and links, contact information, and legal information.

css:-
The CSS code sets some general styles using the * selector to reset margins, paddings, and font-family.
Specific styles are applied to different elements using class and id selectors.
The navbar section is styled with a background color, fixed position, and various alignments.
The main content section and other sections have background images and specific positioning and styling.
Buttons and cards have specific styles, including background colors, border-radius, and hover effects.
The footer section has a specific background color and is divided into different containers with flexbox for positioning.
Overall, the HTML and CSS code structure and styling aim to create a visually appealing and functional website for a Maggi clone, with navigation, recipe sections, and other relevant content.
